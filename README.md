# SIR


This algorithm analyzes the SIR model which is a mathematical description of the spread of a disease through the variables of people who are suspectible, infected or recovered from the disease. We will also see how the introduction of new variables/modifications can affect the SIR model. In the modified SIR model with these new modifications that we will compare with our base SIR model, we will add the two new variables of immunisation against the disease as some people have natural resistance against the disease as soon as they are born or develop in their lifetime and also deaths. The death variable is very important and relevant because not everyone who contracts the disease can always recover and some lose their lives due to it.
